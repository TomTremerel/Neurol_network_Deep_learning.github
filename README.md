# Neurol network

Hi there!👋

I'm proud to present my first neural network and project in deep learning. I've spent a lot of time understanding how an artificial neural network works. 😱 

Now, it's finally here! I followed various courses to complete this project. Thanks to these technological breakthroughs(for me 😝), I'll be able to tackle more complex projects in the future.

For the moment, it's only a training model. I haven't yet applied it to a specific project, but it will soon be the case. 

This first graphic shows how the log loss function decreases with 3 layers of 32 neurones and 4000 iterations:

And this is the accuracy score of the model :

I also wanted to show the decision boundary :

All this training has been done with a very simple dataset from scikit-learn.
